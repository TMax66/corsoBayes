# mixed-models-with-R

Workshop initially given Summer 2017, this covers the basics of mixed models, using <span class="pack">lme4</span> as much as possible.  Topics include random intercept and slope models, discussion of crossed vs. nested random effects, some common extensions (e.g. generalized linear mixed models), and other models that deal with dependency in the data.
