<h1>Mixed Models</h1>
<p>While they might be new to you, mixed models have been around a <em>long</em> time. For example, standard ANOVA methods can be seen as special cases of a mixed model. More recently, mixed models have a variety of applications and extensions, allowing them to encompass a diverse range of data situations. They can be seen as a first step in expanding one’s tool set beyond the generalized linear model.</p>
<div id="terminology" class="section level2">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>For the uninitiated, the terminology surrounding mixed models, especially across disciplines, can be a bit confusing. Some terms you might come across regarding these types of models include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variance components</li>
<li>Random intercepts and slopes</li>
<li>Random effects</li>
<li>Random coefficients</li>
<li>Varying coefficients</li>
<li>Intercepts- and/or slopes-as-outcomes</li>
<li>Hierarchical linear models</li>
<li>Multilevel models (implies multiple levels of hierarchically clustered data)</li>
<li>Growth curve models (possibly Latent GCM)</li>
<li>Mixed effects models</li>
</ul>
<p>All describe types of mixed models. Some might be more historical, others are more often seen in a specific discipline, others might refer to a certain data structure, and still others are special cases. <span class="emph">Mixed effects</span>, or simply mixed, models generally refer to a mixture of fixed and random effects. For the models in general, I prefer the terms ‘mixed models’ or ‘random effects models’ because they are simpler terms, no specific structure is implied, and the latter can also apply to extensions that many would not think of when other terms are used<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Regarding the mixed effects, <span class="emph">fixed effects</span> is perhaps a poor but nonetheless stubborn term for the typical main effects one would see in a linear regression model, i.e. the non-random part of a mixed model, and in some contexts they are referred to as the <em>population average</em> effect. Though you will hear many definitions, random effects are simply those specific to an observational unit, however defined. The approach outlined in this document largely pertains to the case where the observational unit is the level of some grouping factor, but this is only one possibility.</p>
</div>
<div id="kinds-of-clustering" class="section level2">
<h2>Kinds of clustering</h2>
<p>Data might have one or multiple sources of clustering, and that clustering may be hierarchical, such that clusters are nested within other clusters. An example would be scholastic aptitude tests given multiple times to students (repeated observations nested within students, students nested within schools, schools nested within districts). In other cases, there is no nesting structure. An example would be a reaction time experiment where participants perform the same set of tasks. While observations are nested within individual, observations are also clustered according to task type. Some use the terms <span class="emph">nested</span> and <span class="emph">crossed</span> to distinguish between these scenarios. In addition, clustering may be balanced or not. We might expect more balance in studies of an experimental nature, but definitely not in other cases, e.g. where the cluster is something like geographical unit and the observations are people.</p>
<p>In what follows we’ll see mixed effect models in all these data situations. In general, our approach will be the same, as such clustering is really more a property of the data than the model. However, it’s important to get a sense of the flexibility of mixed models to handle a variety of data situations.</p>

<h2>Random Intercepts model</h2>
<p>For the following we’ll demonstrate the simplest<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and most common case of a mixed model, that in which we have a single grouping structure for the random effect added to the standard regression situation. For reasons that will hopefully become clear soon, this is commonly called a random intercepts model. We will also see an extension of it later.</p>

<div id="example-student-gpa" class="section level2">
<h2>Example: student GPA</h2>
<p>For the following we’ll assess factors predicting college grade point average (GPA). Each of the 200 students is assessed for six occasions (each semester for the first three years), so we have observations clustered within students. We have other variables such as job status, sex, and high school GPA. Some will be in both labeled and numeric form. See the <a href="appendix.html#appendix">appendix</a> for more detail.</p>

<h2>The standard regression model</h2>
<p>Now for the underlying model. We can show it in a couple different ways. First we start with just a standard regression to get our bearings.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>We have coefficients (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>) for the intercept and the effect of time. The error (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>) is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and some standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \sigma)\]</span></p>
<p>An alternate way to write the model which puts emphasis on the underlying data generating process for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{gpa}\)</span> can be shown as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} \sim \mathscr{N}(\mu, \sigma)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\mu = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion}\]</span></p>
<p>More technically, the GPA and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> variables have an implicit subscript to denote each observation, but you can also think of it as a model for a single individual at a single time point.</p>

<h5>Initial depiction</h5>
<p>Now we show one way of showing it as a mixed model that includes a unique effect for each student. Consider the following model for a single student<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. This depiction shows that the student-specific effect, i.e. the deviation in GPA just for that student being who they are, can be seen as an additional source of variance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} + (\mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}} + \epsilon)\]</span></p>
<p>We (usually) assume the following for the student effects.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}} \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \tau)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus the student effects are random, and specifically are normally distributed with mean of zero and some estimated standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>). In other words, conceptually the only difference between this mixed model and a standard regression is the student effect, which is <em>on average</em> no effect, but typically varies from student to student by some amount that is on average <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we rearrange it, we can instead focus on model coefficients rather than as an additional source of error.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = (b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}}) + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} +  \epsilon\]</span>
Or more succinctly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathscr{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathscr{occasion} +  \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p>In this way, we’ll have student-specific intercepts, as each person will have their own unique effect added to the overall intercept, resulting in a different intercept for each person.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} \sim \mathscr{N}(b_{\mathrm{intercept}}, \tau)\]</span></p>
<p>Now we see the <em>intercepts</em> as normally distributed with a mean of the overall intercept and some standard deviation. As such this is often called a <span class="emph">random intercepts</span> model.</p>
</div>
<div id="as-a-multi-level-model" class="section level5">
<h5>As a multi-level model</h5>
<p>A form of that second depiction is commonly seen in the <span class="emph">multilevel modeling</span> literature. It is shown more explicitly as a two part regression model, one at the observation level and one at the student level.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span></p>
<p>However, after ‘plugging in’ the second level part to the first, it is identical to the previous.</p>
<p>Note how we don’t have a student-specific effect for occasion. In this context, occasion is said to be a <em>fixed effect</em> only, and there is no random component. This definitely does not have to be the case though, as we’ll see later.</p>

<p>It always helps to look before we leap, so let’s do so. Here we plot GPA vs. occasion (i.e. semester) to get a sense of the variability in starting points and trends.</p>

<p>All student paths are shown in faded paths, with a sample of 10 shown in bold. The overall trend, as estimated by the regression we’ll do later, is shown in red. Two things stand out. One is that students have a lot of variability in starting out. Secondly, while the general trend in GPA is upward over time as we’d expect, individual students may vary in that trajectory.</p>
</div>
<div id="standard-regression" class="section level4">
<h4>Standard regression</h4>
<p>So let’s get started. First, we’ll look at the regression and only the time indicator as a covariate, which we’ll treat as numeric. Note that I present a cleaner version of the summarized objects for the purposes of this document.</p>

<p>The above tells us that starting out, i.e. when occasion is zero, the average GPA, denoted by the intercept, is 2.6. In addition, as we move from semester to semester, we can expect GPA to increase by about 0.11 points. This would be fine except that we are ignoring the clustering. A side effect of doing so is that our standard errors are biased, and thus claims about statistical significance based on them would be off. More importantly however is that we simply don’t get to explore the student effect, which would be of interest by itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-by-cluster" class="section level4">
<h4>Regression by cluster</h4>
<p>An alternative approach would be to run separate regressions for every student. However, there are many drawbacks to this- it’s not easily summarized when there are many groups, typically there would be very little data within each cluster to do so (as in this case), and the models are over-contextualized, meaning they ignore what students have in common. We’ll compare such an approach to the mixed model later.</p>
</div>
<div id="mixed-model" class="section level4">
<h4>Mixed model</h4>
<p>Next we run a mixed model that will allow for a student specific effect. Such a model is easily conducted in R, specifically with the package <span class="pack">lme4</span>. In the following, the code will look just like what you used for regression with <span class="func">lm</span>, but with an additional component specifying the group, i.e. student, effect. The <code>(1|student)</code> means that we are allowing the intercept, represented by <code>1</code>, to vary by student. With the mixed model, we get the same results as the regression, but as we’ll see we’ll have more to talk about.</p>

<p>First we see that the coefficients, i.e. or in this context they can be called the <em>fixed</em> effects, for the intercept and time are the same<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> as we saw with the standard regression, as would be their interpretation. The standard errors, on the other hand are different here, though in the end our conclusion as far as statistical significance goes would be the same. Note specifically that the standard error for the intercept has increased. Conceptually you can think about allowing random intercepts per person allows us to gain information about the individual, while recognizing the uncertainty with regard to the overall average that we were underestimating before<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>While we have coefficients, and standard errors, you might have noticed that <span class="pack">lme4</span> does not provide p-values! There are <a href="https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#why-doesnt-lme4-display-denominator-degrees-of-freedomp-values-what-other-options-do-i-have">several reasons</a> for this, namely that with mixed models we are essentially dealing with different sample sizes, the <span class="math inline">\(N_c\)</span> within cluster, which may vary from cluster to cluster (and even be a single observation!), and N total observations, which puts us in kind of a fuzzy situation with regard to reference distributions, denominator degrees of freedom and how to approximate a ‘best’ solution. Other programs provide p-values automatically as if there is no issue, and without telling you <em>which</em> approach they use to calculate them (there are several). Furthermore, those approximations may be very poor in some scenarios, or make assumptions that may not be appropriate for the situation<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s more straightforward to get confidence intervals, and we can do so with <span class="pack">lme4</span> as follows<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

<h5>Variance components</h5>
<p>One thing that’s new compared to the standard regression output is the estimated variance/standard deviation of the student effect (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> in our formula depiction from before). This tells us how much, on average, GPA bounces around as we move from student to student. In other words, even after making a prediction based on time point, each student has their own unique deviation, and that value (in terms of the standard deviation) is the estimated average deviation across students. Note that scores move due to the student more than double what they move based on a semester change.</p>
<p>Another way to interpret the variance output is to note percentage of the student variance out of the total, or 0.064 / 0.122 = 52%. This is also called the <span class="emph">intraclass correlation</span>, because it is also an estimate of the within cluster correlation, as we’ll see later.</p>

<p>Note that we did not allow occasion to vary, so it is a constant, i.e. <em>fixed</em>, effect for all students.</p>
<p>Often, we are keenly interested in these effects, and want some sense of uncertainty regarding them. With <span class="pack">lme4</span> this typically would be done via bootstrapping, specifically with the <span class="func">bootMer</span> function within <span class="pack">lme4</span>. However, for some users this may be a bit of a more complex undertaking. The <span class="pack">merTools</span> package provides for an easy way to get this with the <span class="func">predictInterval</span> function<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Or you can go straight to the plot of them.</p>

<p>We can see that the predictions from the mixed model are shifted because of having a different intercept. For these students, the shift reflects their relatively poor start.</p>

<div id="cluster-level-covariate" class="section level2">
<h2>Cluster level covariate</h2>
<p>Note our depiction of a mixed model as a multilevel model.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion} + \epsilon\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span>
If we add student a student level covariate, e.g sex, to the model, we then have the following.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[b_{\mathrm{int\_student}} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{sex}\cdot \mathrm{sex} +  \mathrm{effect}_{\mathrm{student}}\]</span></p>
<p>Which, after plugging in, we still have the same model as before, just with an additional predictor.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{gpa} = b_{\mathrm{intercept}} + b_{\mathrm{occ}}\cdot \mathrm{occasion}+ b_{sex}\cdot \mathrm{sex} + (\mathrm{effect}_{\mathscr{student}} + \epsilon)\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, adding cluster level covariates doesn’t have any unusual effect on how we think about the model<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. We simply add them to our set of predictor variables. Note also, that we can create cluster level covariates as means or some other summary of the observation level variables. This is especially common when the clusters represent geographical units and observations are people. For example, we might have income as a person level covariate, and use the median to represent the overall wealth of the geographical region.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Mixed models allow for us to take into account clustering in the data. If this were all it was used for, we would have more accurate inference relative to what would be had if we ignored the structure in the data. However, we get much more. We better understand the sources of variability in the target variable. We also get group specific estimates of the parameters in the model, allowing us to understand exactly how the groups differ from one another. Furthermore, this in turn allows for group specific prediction, and thus much more accurate prediction, assuming there is appreciable variance due to the clustering. In short, there is much to be gained by mixed models, even in the simplest of settings.</p>

<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>For this exercise, we’ll use the sleep study data from the <span class="pack">lme4</span> package. The following describes it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. Starting that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. The observations represent the average reaction time (in milliseconds) on a series of tests given each day to each subject.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I actually like <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Richly-Parameterized-Linear-Models-Additive-Time-Series-and-Spatial/Hodges/p/book/9781439866832">Richly Parameterized Linear Models</a>, or <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642343322">Structured Additive Regression Models</a>. Both are a mouthful, but at least the latter reduces to <a href="http://m-clark.github.io/workshops/stars/">STARs</a>.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Actually, the simplest model would have no covariates at all, just <span class="emph">variance components</span>, with no correlations among the random effects. Such a model can be interesting to look at while exploring your data, but would probably never suffice on its own to tell the story you desire to.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Note that I leave out the observation level subscript to keep things clean. I find that multilevel style notation quickly becomes unwieldy, and don’t wish to reproduce it. It also tends to add confusion to a lot of applied researchers starting out with mixed models.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>This will not always be the case, e.g. with unbalanced data, but they should be fairly close.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The standard error for our time covariate went down due to our estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> being lower for this model, and there being no additional variance due to cluster membership.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Note that many common modeling situations involve a fuzzy p setting, but especially penalized regression approaches such as mixed, additive, ridge regression models etc. Rather than be a bad thing, this usually is a sign you’re doing something interesting, or handling complexity in an appropriate way.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>See <code>?confint.merMod</code> for details and options.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>These are sometimes referred to as BLUPs or EBLUPs, which stands for (empirical) best linear unbiased prediction. However, they are only BLUP for <em>linear</em> mixed effects models. As such you will also see them referred to as <span class="emph">conditional mode</span>. Furthermore, in the Bayesian context, the effects are actually estimated as additional model parameters, rather than estimated/predicted after the fact.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Note that while <span class="func">predictionInterval</span> does not quite incorporate all sources of uncertainty as does <span class="func">bootMer</span>, it’s actually feasible for larger data sets, and on par with the Bayesian results (e.g. with <span class="pack">rstanarm</span>).<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Note that the default plot from <span class="pack">merTools</span> is confusingly labeled for single random effect, because it unnecessarily adds a facet. You’ll understand it better by looking the plot in the discussion of <a href="extensions.html#cross-classified-models">crossed random effects</a> later. However, the one displayed is from my own package, <a href="https://m-clark.github.io/visibly">visibly</a>.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This is why the multilevel depiction is sub-par, and leads many to confusion at times. You have a target variable and predictor variables based on theory. Whether they are cluster level variables or if there are interactions doesn’t have anything to do with the data structure as much as it does the theoretical motivations. However, if you choose to depict the model in multilevel fashion, the final model must adhere to the ‘plugged in’ result. So if, for example, you posit a cluster level variable for a random slope, you <em>must</em> include the implied interaction of the cluster level and observation level covariates. The HLM software goes so far as to even require a separate data set pertaining to cluster level covariates, which is completely unnecessary in R, Stata, SAS etc.<a href="random_intercepts.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
