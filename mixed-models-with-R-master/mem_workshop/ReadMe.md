This folder contains all you need to get started with the Mixed Model workshop.  It contains the following:

- data/: Data folder containing *.RData files that contain the data used in examples and/or exercises (and some others).
- starter.R: A starter script to get you going with the examples used in the document.

Click on the blue mixed_model_workshop_files.Rproj to open this project in RStudio. 

We'll first get our bearings by doing a brief review of linear regression with R. Open the slim_review.Rmd file, it may require you to install additional packages, and if so install them. 

Once we're done with that, open the starter script, and you're all set for the remainder of the workshop.
